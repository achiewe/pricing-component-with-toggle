## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

from this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with styled-components, which allowed me to define and apply css styles to React components in a more intuitive and efficient manner.the main highlight of this code was the demonstration of event handling in the HeaderToggle component. The handleChange function was responsible for updating the changeInput prop when the toggle switch was changed. this event-driven behavior is a fundamental aspect of interactive applications and is crucial for implementing dynamic functionality.
